# Cheat-sheets
My personal collection of useful cheat sheet and notes.  

🏗️ The collection is always changing, and contains community answers and tips.
©️  I provide the reference links from the original sources. 
💫 I recommend to use [obsidian](https://obsidian.md/) as Markdown editor (dynamic graph view)
