## Definition 
[Cross-validation](https://machinelearningmastery.com/k-fold-cross-validation/) is a statistical method used to estimate the skill of machine learning models.

## k-Fold Cross-Validation

Cross-validation is a resampling procedure used to evaluate machine learning models on a limited data sample.

The procedure has a single parameter called **k** that refers to the number of groups that a given data sample is to be split into


It is a popular method because it is simple to understand and because it generally results in a less biased or less optimistic estimate of the model skill than other methods, such as a simple train/test split.

**The general procedure** is as follows:

1.  Shuffle the dataset randomly.
2.  Split the dataset into k groups
3.  For each unique group:
    1.  Take the group as a hold out or test data set
    2.  Take the remaining groups as a training data set
    3.  Fit a model on the training set and evaluate it on the test set
    4.  Retain the evaluation score and discard the model
4.  Summarize the skill of the model using the sample of model evaluation scores

ðŸ”¥A value of k=10 is very common in the field of applied machine learning, and is recommend if you are struggling to choose a value for your dataset.

### Example 

TheÂ _KFold()_Â scikit-learn class can be used. It takes as arguments the number of splits, whether or not to shuffle the sample, and the seed for theÂ [pseudorandom number generator](https://machinelearningmastery.com/how-to-generate-random-numbers-in-python/)Â used prior to the shuffle.

```python
# scikit-learn k-fold cross-validation

from numpy import array

from sklearn.model_selection import KFold

# data sample

data = array([0.1, 0.2, 0.3, 0.4, 0.5, 0.6])

# prepare cross validation

kfold = KFold(3, True, 1)

# enumerate splits

for train, test in kfold.split(data):

print('train: %s, test: %s' % (data[train], data[test]))
```
```python
train: [0.1 0.4 0.5 0.6], test: [0.2 0.3]

train: [0.2 0.3 0.4 0.6], test: [0.1 0.5]

train: [0.1 0.2 0.3 0.5], test: [0.4 0.6]
```
